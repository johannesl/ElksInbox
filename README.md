# ElksInbox

## Description

Sometimes it's nice to be able to send and receive SMS messages directly from your Mac. ElksInbox is a graphical OSX tool that allows you to do just that.

I want to learn doing UI programming and HTTP API integration in Swift, so this was the perfect application for me to build as I can use my existing knowledge of the 46elks API and thus focus on learning Swift.

## Project Location
